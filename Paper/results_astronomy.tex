\subsubsection{B-H$\beta$}
The B-H$\beta$ colour was clustered with V-I in two dimensions, and H$\beta$-V, and H$\beta$-I in three dimensions.

\paragraph{2-Dimensions}
This combination was very sensitive to bandwidth selection. At $h=0.25$ the number of clusters predicted was 32, while at $h=0.4$, the number of clusters was four.
When selecting the optimal meanshift clustering, there was a significant drop in the number of clusters produced for the increase in bandwidth, which occured at $h=0.35$, giving eight clusters, see Figure ~\ref{fig:HBMS}.
This plateau was selected as the optimal clustering.
This selection did not maximize the silhouette score, but the trend in the score followed a similar pattern, and began to plateau at this level.

K-Means produced a segmentation that combined the results seen in previous trials.
The algorithm segmented the data in integers of the V-I colour, and was still able to create clusters for the redder branches of each colour.
The silhouette score plateaued at $K=5$ along with the sum of squares.
The algorithm was able to pick out the red branch in the B-H$\beta$ colour, however after further inspection, the score for that cluster specifically (which measures the cluster specific seperation from every other cluster) was quite low, indicating that the clustering was not as strong as the visual inpsection suggested.
This colour was the first combination to show clear structure in its corresponding colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).
Figure ~\ref{fig:HBCMD} shows the distribution of each cluster in the I vs. V-I space.

\end{figure}

This CMD shows that this clustering was able to segmente the data based on its location in V-I colour space, and reveals detail about cluster 2, which has a magnitude cut-off at approximately 26.
Additionally, cluster 4, the red branch of B-H$\beta$, seems to sweep accross the magnitude distribution. % Need explaination of why

\paragraph{3-Dimensions}
The three dimensional clustering proved again to be more successful in segmenting the distribution. 
K-Means maximized the score at $K=4$, and was able to assign a clear branch of objects to its own cluster, see Figure ~\ref{fig:HBKM3d}.
Additionally, it was able to isolate the densist region of the distribution at zero, while identifying the group of objects very red in the V-I colour.

\end{figure}

Meanshift also performed well in three dimensions.
The relations between meanshift's parameters were not as clear as k-means, but the score plateaued at six clusters, which was chosen as the optimal clustering.
Meanshift was able to identify branches of objects that were clearly apparent in the three dimensional distribution, but also apparent as distinct segments of the H$\beta$-I, B-H$\beta$ distribution, see Figure ~\ref{fig:HB3dMS1} and Figure ~\ref{fig:HB3dMS2}.
Despite its ability to identify these groups, the main cluster detected by meanshift contained close to 96\% of the data.

\paragraph{Astronomy Implications}
While the two dimensional K-Means clustering seems to be more clearly defined in the colour-colour space, the three dimensional clustering seem to cluster objects that have similar colours, but also are very similar in their position in the galaxy.
Cluster two in Figure~\ref{fig:HBKM3d} is a group of dim point sources in some of the denser regions in the spiral arms. 
The similar cluster in two dimensions did not include regions of high density in the spiral arms, despite their similar colours.
The distribution of objects before the red arms remains similar to other colour combinations, where the main large cluster is associated with the densist areas of the spiral arms, and the second largest cluster is associated with the inter-arm region, and the nucleus.
The three dimensional meanshift clustering is able to isolate groups of objects in the galaxy that share similar colours and are located in common areas. 
Cluster 5 in Figure~\ref{fig:HB3dMS2} isolates objects that have the reddest H$\beta$-I colour, and nearly all of these objects are located in isolated regions of the spiral arms, away from the dense areas.
The same pattern follows for each of the smaller clusters in Figure~\ref{fig:HB3dMS2}.


\subsubsection{UVW - U}
The UVW - U combination was tested clustered with the B-I, V-I, and B-V colours. % More general information about what we are looking for in this combination

\paragraph{Mean-Shift}
When clustered using Mean-Shift, a similar pattern of clustering was seen in all combinations.
Due to the structure of the Mean-Shift algorithm, it is drawn towards areas of high density in the distribution. % Refernce meanshift paper
Since the distribution of the UVW-U combinations were generally consentrated around zero in the colour-colour space, the Mean-Shift algorithm would pick out one large cluster with many smaller ones. 
Each smaller cluster had to be investigated to determine if the algorithm had found a meaningful cluster, or if it had just clustered noise.
In order to determine this, a cluster hierarchy was created with different bandwidth values to see how long each cluster lasted in the bandwidth space. 
If a small cluster was created at a low bandwidth level and stayed alive until the number of clusters became 2-3, then it is reasonable to assume that the cluster was meaningful.
Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWMS1} shows the result of one trial of Mean-Shift clustering with $h=0.6$ which created 4 clusters. 
Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWMS2} shows the result of one trial of Mean-Shift clustering with $h=0.4$, creating 10 clusters. 
The structure of cluster $2$ in both Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWMS1} and Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWMS2} can be seen distinctly. 
This cluster would have been viewed as noise if the hierarchy was not created, but after testing multiple bandwidth values, it can be seen that these objects are significant.
Varying the bandwidth did not have a large affect on the number of clusters produced. Bandwidth values from 0.5 to 1.0 only created a difference in three clusters generated.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{K-Means}

When clustered using K-Means, two types of results were seen.
Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWKM1}, shows the result of K-Means clustering for $K=5$ against the B-V colour.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/kmeans_xy_5cl_mag05_225-mag05_336vsmag05_438-mag05_555}

\label{fig:UVWKM1}
\end{figure}

The algorithm split the data into groups based on its UVW - U colour. The pattern continued for all values of K, and the silhouette scores of the combination elbowed at $K=5$.
The second type of result for K-Means can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:UVWKM2}, against the B-I colour. 
This clustering segmented the data into circular groups within the distribution. 
Similar to the B-V combination, the silhouette score elbowed at $K=5$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Astronomy Implications}
After the clustering was performed, the location of the cluster members were imposed on the whitelight image of M83.
The algorithms were able to identify sources that are located in unique sections of the galaxy.
K-Means segmented the data into objects that are located along the spiral arms exclusively, clustered in the denser regions of the arms and nucleus, and in the intra-arm region.
This pattern of object location was found through all combinations of broad - broad colours.
The Mean-Shift segmentation was able to identify objects that were located in the spiral arms.
The objects that were not part of the main cluster appear to be point sources that fall in the back of the galaxy, or are some form of cloud or dust.
