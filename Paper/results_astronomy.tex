\[ To be reorganized \]

This section outlines how the clustering algorithms were able to segment the data into different types of objects, and their location in M83.
In order to determine the properties of the objects in each cluster, each cluster was plotted on the "whitelight" image developed by \citet{chandar10}. % Add more reference to the image if needed
